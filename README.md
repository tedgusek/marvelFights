This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

If you are loading this on your local machine, you will need to sign up for an account with Marvel to acquire a Personal and Public API key. As well as with OpenAI.

Create your own .env file and store these values with the variable names as follows :

- Private Key

MARVEL_API_KEY_PRIVATE= 'Enter your Marvel Private Key here'

- Public Key

MARVEL_API_KEY_PUBLIC= 'Enter your Marvel Public Key here'

- OpenAI Key

OPENAI_API_KEY='Enter your OpenAI key here'

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

# marvelFights

This app is built using the Maervel API to interact with their database of characters. It is still in Beta. It also utilizes the power of OpenAI to create fictional Battole descriptions and create imagery of these battles. This App is also still in Beta and will continue to be iterated on to create a more well rounded user experience of bringing the debates of who would win into the digital realm.
